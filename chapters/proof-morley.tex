At this point we've made good progress towards the proof of Morley's Categoricity theorem.
It suffices to show that uncountable categoricity (for any uncountable cardinal) is equivalent to \(\omega\)-stability and lacking Vaughtian pairs.
As this property doesn't depend on the uncountable cardinality, this suffices. 

We've already shown that \(\omega\)-stability and lacking Vaughtian pairs are necessary for uncountable categoricity.
To show these conditions are also sufficient we will define a notion of ``dimension'' for elementary extensions.
\(\omega\)-stability will tell us that we can view any two models as elementary extensions of the same \textit{prime model}.
The fact that, because of their cardinalities, any equinumerous models will have the same dimension over this prime model.
Having the same dimension over this prime model will suffice to show that these two models are isomorphic.
This will complete the proof. 

\subsection{Prime Models}

\textbf{Definition.} We say that a theory, \(T\),  has a prime model, \(\mcM \models T\) if, for every \(\mcN \models T\), we have \(\mcM \prec \mcN\). 
Clearly, prime models are unique up to isomorphism. Easy examples of prime models are \(\Q\) for fields of characteristic 0 and \(\N\) for \(\Th(\N, 0, s)\). % Examples?

\textbf{Theorem.} \omst theories have prime models.

% Strongly minimal formula with params from prime model

\textbf{Definition.} We say that a \(\mcL_\mcM\)-formula \(\phi\) is \textit{minimal} if \(\phi(\mcM) = \{\bar{m} \in M \mid \mcM \models \phi(\bar{m})\) is infinite and has no infinite and co-infinite definable subsets. 
We may also call \(\phi(\mcM)\) minimal. 
We will call \(\phi\) % and \phi(\mcM)\) -- This could use some work 
\textit{strongly minimal} if it is  minimal in any elementary extension of \(\mcM\).

Now, assume we have a theory which is \omst and has no Vaughtian-pairs. 
As it is \omst it has a prime model.
We will show that it's being \omst also tells us that there is a minimal formula in its prime model.
We will also show this formula is strongly minimal since the theory has no vaughtian pairs. 

\textbf{Lemma.} If \(T\) is \omst there is a minimal formula in all \(\mcM \models T\).
Assume there is no minimal formula {\color{red}\(\ldots\) ????} % This is pretty Hard

\textbf{Lemma.} If \(T\) has no Vaughtian pairs and \(\phi\) is a minimal formula for \(\mcM \models T\) then \(\phi\) is strongly-minimal.
