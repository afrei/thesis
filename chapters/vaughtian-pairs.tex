\subsection{Definition}
The (only) obstacle to uncountable categoricity aside from \(\omega\)-instability is the existence of Vaughtian pairs. %6-3
We will be able to use a Vaughtian pair of models of a theory to construct a model of size \(\kappa\) with a countable definable subset.  
Such models prevent uncountable categoricity because given any model of cardinality \(\kappa\) we can construct an elementarily equivalent model in which all infinite definable sets are of cardinality \(\kappa\).
We simply add \(\kappa\) many vectors of constant symbols for each formula \(\phi\) defining an infinite set, assert that none of the vectors of constant symbols are equal. This is clearly finitely satisfiable and its model has the desired property.
First, let's define what it means for two models to form a Vaughtian pair. % Possible Addition: Definition of kappa lambda models (definition in previous commits)

\textbf{Definition.} \((\mcM, \mcN)\) form a Vaughtian pair if \(\mcM \prec \mcN\) and there is an \(\mcL_\mcM\)-formula \(\phi(\bar{v})\) for which
\(\{\bar{m} \in N^k \mid \mcN \models \phi(\bar{n})\}\) is an infinite subset of \(M^k\). %7-1 
In other words, a formula with parameters in \(M\) defines an infinite subset of \(N^k\) containing no elements of \(N^k \setminus M^k\).

\textbf{Claim 1.} Assuming a theory \(T\) has a Vaughtian pair \(\mcM, \mcN\), it has a Vaughtian pair \((\mcM_0, \mcN_0)\) of countable models. 

In order to show the existence of a countable model, we will want to use the L\"owenheim-Skolem theorm.
To do so, we will have to view the pair of models as a single model. 
Let  \(\mcL^* = \mcL \cup \{U\}\). 
We look at \(\mcN\) as an \(\mcL^*\)-structure where \(U\) is the subset \(M\). 
This predicate allows us to state that a formula \(\phi(\bar{v})\) is true in \(\mcM\).
For \(\phi(\bar{v})\) \qf we let \(\phi_U(\bar{v}) = \bigwedge U(v_i) \land \phi(\bar{v})\) and for \(\phi(\bar{v}) = \exists v \psi, \phi_U(\bar{v}) = \E v (U(v) \land \psi_U)\). 
In the other cases, do the natural thing. %7-2

Our goal is to demonstrate a theory in a countable language asserting that \((\mcM, \mcN)\) is Vaughtian pair. %7-3
By the L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem, we will get out countable pair of models.
This comes in two parts: asserting \(\mcM \prec \mcN\) and asserting that we can isolate an infinite subset of \(M\). 
We assert the former with the formulae \((\bigwedge U(v_i) \land \psi(\bar{v})) \to \psi_U(\bar{v})\). 
Let \(\phi(\bar{v})\) be the \(\mcL_\mcM\)-formula which isolates an infinite subset of \(M^k\). 
We can assert that \(\phi\) has infinitely many realizations by \(\E \bar{v}_1, \E \bar{v}_2, \ldots \E \bar{v}_n \bigwedge \bar{v}_i \neq \bar{v}_j \land \bigwedge \phi(\bar{v}_i)\). %7-4
We can assert that \(\phi\) only holds for vectors from \(M^k\) by \(\A \bar{v} (\phi(\bar{v}) \to U(\bar{v}))\).
Finally, we assert that \(\mcN\) is a proper extension with \(\E x \neg U(x)\). 
By construction, the countable model of this theory which is satisfied by \((\mcM, \mcN)\) will be our countable model.

For the next few claims we will need to use a property called homogeneity which will allow us to show that certain countable models are isomorphic.
\textbf{Definition.} We call a countable model \(\mcM\) is homogeneous if all finite \(A \subset M\) and functions \(f: A \to M\) for which \(\mcM \models \phi(\bar{v}) \iff \mcM \models \phi(f(\bar{v}))\) -- we call this property being ``partial elementary'' -- and every \(m \in M\), there is a \(f': A \cup \{m\} \to M\) extending \(f\) which is partial elementary. % Examples?

The first interesting thing we will note about countable homogeneous models is that any partial elementary map \(f: A \to M\) (where \(A \subset M\) is finite) can be extended to an automorphism. 
To see this, note that partial elementary maps have partial elementary inverses. And \(f_0 = f\) %this bad
We will alternatively extend the domain and range of \(f_i\) by elements in \(M\). 
By construction, \(f^* = \bigcup_{<\omega}f_i\) has domain and range equal to all of \(M\). %something here
Additionally, it is easy to verify that \(f^*\) is a homomorphism. 

This is why homogeneity is a useful property. We can use it to build isomorphisms, which will be useful soon. 

\textbf{Lemma.}The next thing we note about countable homogeneous models, \(\mcM\) and \(\mcN\), of the same complete theory, \(T\), is that if \(\mcM\) and \(\mcN\) realize the same types, they are isomorphic.
To show this, we will build a map in a way very similar to the way we built \(f^*\) above. 
Note that we need \(T\) to be complete in order for \(f_0=\emptyset\) to be partial elementary.
We will enumerate the elements in the universe of both models, and iteratively add elements to the domain and range of a partial elementary map. 
If we can do this, the union of this sequence of maps will be an isomorphism.
As the inverse of a partial elementary map is also partial elementary, it will suffice to show that we can extend a partial elementary map to include an arbitrary element in its range. 
Let \(dom(f) = \{m_1, \ldots, m_i\}, rng(f) = \{n_1, \ldots, n_i\}, f(m_j) = n_j\).
Now, choose \{m\} an arbitrary element of \(M\), our goal is to find \(g \supset f\) which is partial elementary and \(m \in dom(g)\).
Note that we can find a partial elementary \(h\) for which \(dom(f) \cup \{m\} \subset dom(h)\) by merely finding the realization of \(tp(\bar{m}, m)\) in \(\mcN\), which is guarunteed by \(\mcM, \mcN\) realizing the same types. 
Our one remaining obstacle is that \(h(m_i)\) may not be equal to \(n_i\). 
This can be rectified with homogeneity. We can easily see that the function which takes \(h(m_i) \mapsto n_i\) can be extended to an automorphism. 
By simply composing this automorphism with our \(h\) from above to form \(g\) we have found our desired function. 

% Possible Clarification: Moving from types over models to types over theories

\textbf{Claim 2.} Moreover, a Vaughtian pair of countable models can be extended to a Vaughtian pair of isomorphic countable models.

By above, it suffices to show a vaughtian pair \((\mcM, \mcN)\) can be extended to a vaughtian pair \((\mcM^*, \mcN^*)\) where \(\mcM^*, \mcN^*\) are homogeneous and realize the same types. 

% TODO 1: Proof of 4.3.38
\textcolor{red}{Insert Proof Here \ldots}

\textbf{Claim 3.} Given a Vaughtian pair of countable isomorphic models, we can construct a Vaughtian pair \((\mcN_1, \mcN_2)\) where \(\mcM\) is countable and \(\mcN\) can be taken to be of any cardinality. % Possible Alternative: show for \(\aleph_1\). Then grow out to all uncountable kappa. (4th claim in previous commits)

% TODO 2: Proof of 4.3.34/4.3.41 
\textcolor{red}{Insert Proof Here \ldots} 
% First line? We have an easy way to grow models once we have \((\mcN_1 \prec \mcN_2)\) and \(\mcN_1 \isom \mcN_2\). 

As we stated above, we can also create a model of \(T\) of size \(\kappa\) where all infinite definable sets are of size \(\kappa\). 
Such a model wouldn't be isomorphic to the model we just created which has a countable definable subset. 
Therefore, theories admitting Vaughtian pairs cannot be categorical in any uncountable cardinality.
