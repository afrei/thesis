\subsection{Definition}
The (only) obstacle to uncountable categoricity aside from \(\omega\)-instability is the existence of Vaughtian pairs.
We will be able to use a Vaughtian pair of models of a theory to construct a model of size \(\kappa\) with a countable definable subset.  
Such models prevent uncountable categoricity because given any model of cardinality \(\kappa\) we can construct an elementarily equivalent model in which all infinite definable sets are of cardinality \(\kappa\).
We simply add \(\kappa\) many vectors of constant symbols for each formula \(\phi\) defining an infinite set, assert that none of the vectors of constant symbols are equal. This is clearly finitely satisfiable and its model has the desired property.
First, let's define what it means for two models to form a Vaughtian pair.% and what it means for a model to be a \((\kappa, \lambda)\)-model.

%\textbf{Definition.} A model \(\mcM\) is a \((\kappa, \lambda)\)-model if \(\kappa > \lambda \geq \aleph_0\) and \(|M| = \kappa\) but there is an \(\mcL\)-formula \(\phi\) for which
%\(|\{\bar{m} \in M^k \mid \mcM \models \phi(\bar{M})\}| = \lambda\).

\textbf{Definition.} \((\mcM, \mcN)\) for a Vaughtian pair if \(\mcM \prec \mcN\) and there is an \(\mcL_\mcM\)-formula \(\phi(\bar{v})\) for which
\(\{\bar{m} \in N^k \mid \mcN \models \phi(\bar{n})\}\) is an infinite subset of \(M^k\). 
In other words, a formula with parameters in \(M\) defines an infinite subset of \(N^k\) containing no elements of \(N^k \setminus M^k\).

\textbf{Claim 1.} Assuming a theory \(T\) has a Vaughtian pair \(\mcM, \mcN\), it has a Vaughtian pair \((\mcM_0, \mcN_0)\) of countable models. 

In order to show the existence of a countable model, we will want to use the L\"owenheim-Skolem theorm.
To do so, we will have to view the pair of models as a single model. 
Let  \(\mcL^* = \mcL \cup \{U\}\). 
We look at \(\mcN\) as an \(\mcL^*\)-structure where \(U\) is the subset \(M\). 
This predicate allows us to state that a formula \(\phi(\bar{v})\) is true in \(\mcM\).
For \(\phi(\bar{v})\) \qf we let \(\phi_U(\bar{v}) = \bigwedge U(v_i) \land \phi(\bar{v})\) and for \(\phi(\bar{v}) = \exists v \psi, \phi_U(\bar{v}) = \E v (U(v) \land \psi_U)\). 
In the other cases, do the natural thing. 

Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate a theory in a countable language asserting that \((\mcM, \mcN)\) is Vaughtian pair.
By the L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem, we will get out countable pair of models.
This comes in two parts: asserting \(\M \prec \mcN\) and asserting that we can isolate an infinite subset of \(M\). 
We assert the former with the formulae \((\bigwedge U(v_i) \land \psi(\bar{v})) \to \psi_U(\bar{v})\). 
Let \(\phi(\bar{v})\) be the \(\mcL_\mcM\)-formula which isolates an infinite subset of \(M^k\). 
We can assert that \(\phi\) has infinitely many realizations by \(\E \bar{v}_1, \E \bar{v}_2, \ldots \E \bar{v}_n \bigwedge \bar{v}_i \new \bar{v}_j \land \bigwedge \bar{v}_i \neq \bar{v}_j\)
We can assert that \(\phi\) only holds for vectors from \(M^k\) by \(\A \bar{v} (\phi(\bar{v}) \to U(\bar{v}))\)/
Finally, we assert that \(\mcN\) is a proper extension with \(\E x \neg U(x)\). 
By construction, the countable model of this theory which is satisfied by \((\mcM, \mcN)\) will be our countable model.

\textbf{Claim 2.} Moreover, a Vaughtian pair of countable models can be extended to a Vaughtian pair of isomorphic countable models.

\textbf{Claim 3.} Given a Vaughtian pair of countable isomorphic models, we can construct a Vaughtian pair \((\mcM, \mcN)\) where \(\mcM\) is countable and \(\mcN\) can be taken to be of cardinality \(\aleph_1\).

\textbf{Claim 4.} Given a Vaughtian pair \((\mcM, \mcN)\) where \(\mcM\) is countable and \(\mcN\) is of cardinality \(\aleph_1\), we can construct a model of any uncountably cardinality \(\kappa\) with a countable definable subset. 

% Proof Goes Here
\textcolor{red}{Insert Proof Here}

As we stated above, we can also create a model of \(T\) of size \(\kappa\) where all infinite definable sets are of size \(\kappa\). 
Such a model wouldn't be isomorphic to the model we just created which has a countable definable subset. 
Therefore, theories admitting Vaughtian pairs cannot be categorical in any uncountable cardinality.
